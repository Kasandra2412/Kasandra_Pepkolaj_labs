## Lab 1

For this lab I created a main sceen with a forest brackground. As a second scene I added two pgns of 2D characters. 
As per the instructions I added another scene with mutliple instanes of trees and rocks to facilitate a forest. 
From this lab I learned how to add multiple scenes and pictures. By using mutliple scenes I got to learn how they
interact with each other.
